## Introduction

GitHub Actions enables you to automate your software workflows. With runner images, you can easily set up your own self-hosted runners. This repository offers a collection of Docker images tailored for various development needs. Whether you're building, testing, or deploying applications, these images provide a solid foundation.

## Getting Started

To get started with runner images, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Follow these steps to pull and run the images:

1. **Install Docker**: Visit [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.
2. **Pull an Image**: Use the command below to pull the desired runner image:
   ```bash
   docker pull <image-name>
   ```
3. **Run the Image**: After pulling, run the image with:
   ```bash
   docker run <image-name>
   ```

## Images Overview

This repository contains several images optimized for different programming languages and frameworks. Below is a brief overview of the available images:

- **Node.js Runner**: Ideal for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- **Python Runner**: Best for Python applications and testing.
- **Java Runner**: Suitable for Java applications, supporting Maven and Gradle.
- **Ruby Runner**: Designed for Ruby on Rails applications.

Each image comes pre-installed with the necessary tools and libraries for seamless integration with GitHub Actions.

## Usage

To use the runner images in your GitHub Actions workflows, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
2. **Define the Job**: Add a job that uses one of the runner images. Here's an example for a Node.js application:
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       container:
         image: <node-image-name>
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install
         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```

This example shows how to set up a basic CI pipeline using the Node.js runner image.
